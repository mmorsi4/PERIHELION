# PERIHELION
3D Web app to simulate the solar system

# Summary
The project aims to develop a 3D web-based solar system that balances accuracy, creativity, and usability. Users will explore the solar system and observe near-Earth objects (NEOs) precisely and easily. Keplerian equations and realistic models will ensure scientific accuracy, while a visually engaging environment with voice narration will enhance creativity. The platform will feature a clean, intuitive interface with customizable options, making it accessible. Designed to be both educational and enjoyable, the project also offers a learning opportunity for its creators, helping them grow practical skills while developing a meaningful tool for space enthusiasts.
